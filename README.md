TwisTorr 305 FS
==============

## Overview

This repository contains a data acquisition and monitoring system for the Agilent TwisTorr 305 FS turbo molecular pump. The system continuously reads critical pump parameters such as pressure readings, temperature, rotation frequency, pump status, and error codes via a TCP/IP connection. The collected data is then stored in a PostgreSQL database with JSONB format for efficient querying and visualization through Grafana dashboards. This setup enables real-time monitoring of pump performance, historical data analysis, and early detection of potential issues for preventive maintenance in vacuum systems.
